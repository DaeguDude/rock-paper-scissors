# REFACTORED!!

Having difficulty of doing **TodoList** project more than 2.5 months, I had to understand that I have difficulty of separating the parts that will eventually build cool thing(TodoList). I was trying to do it in one go. I MUST separate things. Refactoring Rock Paper Scissors was sort of practice before actually jumping into the bigger one.

- Here's the [live](https://daegudude.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

- And here's the [source code](https://github.com/DaeguDude/rock-paper-scissors/tree/master/src) 

I have used webpack to bundle things together.

# ~~rock-paper-scissors(OUTDATED)~~

This is a part of project of The Odin Project.

What we've learned here was,
* DOM Manipulation
* Javascript Events Handling

It was a fun experience, because with the knowledges we've learned,
I could actually make something.
That had me a feeling of actually I was capable of being a programmer.
Well done!

Nevertherless, there are a few things that I could improve more
* How to patiently google

    Because I often opt for the easy and quick solution, but I found myself that
it's actually taking more time than I think, and becoming very unefficient.
And most importantly, I learn nothing. So, google patiently, read questions & answers thoroughly

* Sorting the problems

    When building a program, often I find myself jump to the other problems in the middle
of other problems. And that causes me not being able to focus on one thing, and it seems
impossible to actually program something. So I guess I first need to sort the problems, and work on 
one at a time
